# HDL-ISE-Verilog-Nexsys2-StopWatch
Stopwatch with milliseconds accuracy using Verilog ( This code is implemented on Nexsys2 board )    

This code base was developed using ISE Design suit for acadamic purposes. 

50MHz clock of Nexsys2 FPGA board has ben used in here to generate millisecond clock pulse. So according to your FPGA board and clock change the number of clock cycles which got counted for 1 milisecond.

PinAssignment.ucf file contains pin mapping for Nexsys2 board. Depending on the board you are using change the pin assignment as well.
